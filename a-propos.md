I am a passionate developer with 23 years of experience, including 10 years in Scala and 7 years in Data. I consider myself a software craftsmanship and prioritize simplicity.

I am interested in and have a strong experience in:
- Data engineering
- Functional Programming
- JVM Performance

I share my knowledge by writing on [my blog](https://www.yannmoisan.com) and on Medium: [3 articles on Spark](https://medium.com/@yamo93).

I am constantly learning, including attending user group events (Java, Scala, Hadoop, etc.) and taking online courses (Scala, MongoDB M101J).

I love opensource:
- I have written two open-source libraries: [graphite4s](https://github.com/YannMoisan/graphite4s) and [sbopt](https://github.com/YannMoisan/sbopt), and created a [hands-on tutorial on the cats library](https://github.com/YannMoisan/hands-on-cats).
- I have reported bugs: [BATCH-1778](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/issues/1812), [MAHOUT-1068](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-1068)
- I have submitted fixes: [Casbah 59](https://github.com/mongodb/casbah/pull/59), [MAHOUT-1044](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-1044), [FluentLenium#182](https://github.com/FluentLenium/FluentLenium/pull/182), [swagger-play](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-play/pull/53/files), [SPARKC-458](https://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector/pull/1216), [case-app](https://github.com/alexarchambault/case-app/pull/225), [ammonite-spark](https://github.com/alexarchambault/ammonite-spark/pull/58).

I also practice algorithmics and competitive programming:

- Ranked 153rd out of 3 million on [codingame](https://www.codingame.com/profile/ac2d137258e2a4fef87ec64dcdd1b5eb539451).
- Earned 336 stars out of 400 on Advent of Code.
- Solved 39 problems on Project Euler.
